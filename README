This program will allow a user to create exported files based upon the given ddl file.  Currently, this only works exporting a Lift ORM mapper class.

Currently take a look at the test folder for a schema that will go through the script fine.

PLEASE NOTE:
Currently this script does not work with a lot of different grammars.  Basically it looks for insert statements and creates the appropriate classes.  As time and needs dictate this will be expanded.

RELEASE NOTES 1.1
* Added some testing code based upon Scala test.
* Implemented a writer factory, writer abstract class, and a LiftORM writer definition.
* Made some reorganizations to make it more modular.

There are a lot of improvements I would like to make...
* Handle create index calls...write now it just errors out
* Create foreign key relationships from the DDL passed in 
* Handle ALTER clauses
* Handle all ddl grammars and do something better than error out
* Improve the command-line handling and error reporting.
* Clean-up code

To compile do the following in the root directory...
maven compile

To run 
cd target/classes
scala -classpath . main testSchema1.sql [outputPath] [WriterToUse]

Example of a run is
scala -classpath . main testSchema1.sql output/ LiftORM

Please NOTE THAT CURRENTLY THE ONLY IMPLEMENTED WRITER IS LiftORM
